Currently facilitating growth in the Microsoft Cloud by managing and prioritizing data center ticketing queues and vendor coordination based on current resources and SLA requirements.

In addition to my regular responsibilities, I am a Microsoft "Leaper", which means I'm a part of the apprenticeship program to train up to being a software engineer.
